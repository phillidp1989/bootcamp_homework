## Responsive Portfolio

In this project, I created three linked webpages with the aim of creating a responsive design, ensuring the web application rendered well on a variety of devices and screen sizes. The approach taken was mobile-first through utilisation of Bootstrap components.

## Brief


<ul>

<li>Create three files - index.html, portfolio.html and contact.html</li>
<li>Use Bootstrap to create a navbar, responsive layout and responsive images</li>
<li>Minimise the use of media queries using Bootstrap</li>
<li>Use imgaes provided by the instructor to replicate a responsive website</li></ul>

## Minimum Requirements

Functional, deployed application<br>
GitHub repository with README describing the project<br>
Navbar must be consistent on each page.<br>
Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.<br>
All links must work.<br>
Must use semantic html.<br>
Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)<br>
Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)<br>
Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.<br><br>

I approached the task by using the images provided of the smallest (mobbile) viewport as I was using a mobile-first approaqch to the development of these web applications. I started from the top of the page with the brand/header and the navbar and worked my way down the page to create each of the content elements, utilising Bootstrap components where possible. I then created a custom CSS file to add my own styling where Bootstrap could not achieve the desire output. <br><br>

I then looked at the images of the large screen viewports to assess whether Bootstrap code had provided sufficient responsiveness to meet the brief. In some cases, I had to create custom media queries to amend the styling (most notably the header and navbar) for appropriate responsiveness across devices.


## Challenges

The main challenge I faced was concerning an over reliance on using Bootstrap components to create the web application. I then tried to apply custom CSS to make the output as similar as possible to the model images. The Bootstrap components were quite limiting and sometimes prevented me applying styling that I wanted, so I relied on custom html and css code more than I though would have been the case. However, this gave me greater flexibility to create a decent output based on the images.

The responsiveness requirements was also challenging, particularly the need to cater for at least 3 different screen sizes and therefore requiring multiple media queries. I found myself thinking I had produced a successful output, only to find that any code changes I had made had caused issues on another viewport.

## What did I learn?

The challenges referenced above provided great learning opportunitiesas I needed to do lots of research on Bootstrap, flexbox, sticky footers, navbars, block elements, inline elements etc. I am now much more confident in constructing a web application from scratch that is responsive to the user's device.
